This is a somewhat themed challenge I wrote for RITCTF 2022, in April 2022. This was intended to be an easy steganography CTF with a bit of an unusual twist.

This was written primarily for Linux, although there may be a solution for Windows. 

The ```stgeasy.py``` file contains the writeup and commands to complete the challenge, but I don't think it should be necessary. Start the challenge by downloading the entire folder and inspecting the image files. 

I hope you learn something new, and enjoy!
